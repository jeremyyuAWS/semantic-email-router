This is compromising patient care and requires immediate technical response.\n\n**PRIMARY FAILURES (Critical - Patient Impact):**\n\n1. **ICU Ventilator Bank #3 (East Wing)**\n   - 4x Siemens Servo-i ventilators showing E-5047 errors\n   - Pressure sensors failing intermittently\n   - Affects 12 critical patients currently\n   - Backup ventilators deployed but insufficient capacity\n   - Error pattern suggests common component failure\n\n2. **OR Suite #2 Anesthesia System**\n   - Dräger Perseus A500 - Total system failure at 02:45\n   - Error codes: E-7821, E-7822, E-7831 (cascading)\n   - Surgery halted with patient under anesthesia\n   - Manual ventilation in progress\n   - Estimated repair window: <2 hours critical\n\n3. **Cardiac Cath Lab Imaging**\n   - Philips AlluraClarity FD20 C-arm system down\n   - Generator failure with arcing reported\n   - 3 cardiac procedures postponed\n   - No backup imaging available in sterile environment\n\n**SECONDARY FAILURES (Infrastructure Impact):**\n\n4. **Medical Gas System - Zone 7**\n   - O2 pressure dropping: 50 PSI → 35 PSI (critical at 30)\n   - Backup cylinders activated but limited duration\n   - Manifold leak suspected - affects OR 2, 3, 4\n   - Could cascade to ventilator failures\n\n5. **Infusion Pump Network**\n   - 15x Alaris GP pumps showing network errors\n   - Drug library updates failing\n   - Manual dosing required - medication error risk\n   - Pattern suggests network infrastructure issue\n\n**IMMEDIATE REQUIREMENTS:**\n\n**Emergency Parts Needed (2-hour delivery required):**\n- Siemens Servo-i pressure sensor assemblies (P/N: 6SE70-0DG84-4HC4) - Qty: 6\n- Dräger Perseus flow sensor module (P/N: 8406229) - Qty: 2  \n- Philips X-ray tube assembly (P/N: 9896 000 20451) - Qty: 1\n- Medical gas manifold seals kit (Oxy-Vac compatible) - Qty: 1\n\n**Technical Support Required:**\n- Level 3 biomedical technician (Siemens certified)\n- Dräger anesthesia specialist (on-site within 1 hour)\n- Philips imaging engineer (remote diagnostics capable)\n- Medical gas technician (licensed for OR environment)\n\n**Clinical Contingencies Active:**\n- Patient transfers to sister facility initiated\n- Emergency OR opened in Ambulatory wing  \n- Manual ventilation teams deployed\n- Pharmacy preparing manual infusion protocols\n- Administration coordinating media/family communications\n\n**Root Cause Hypothesis:**\nTimeline analysis suggests electrical transient at 02:30 may have triggered cascade. UPS logs show brief voltage spike. This could explain simultaneous failures across different vendors/systems.\n\n**Regulatory Notifications Required:**\n- Joint Commission incident report\n- FDA adverse event reporting (Class I devices)\n- State health department notification\n- Insurance carrier immediate notice\n\n**Business Continuity:**\n- Estimated revenue impact: $75K/hour (OR closures)\n- Patient diversion costs accumulating\n- Staff overtime at 1.5x rate\n- Reputation management required\n\n**Previous Similar Incidents:**\n- Cascade failure Nov 2024 (resolved in 6 hours)\n- Annual preventive maintenance due next month\n- Vendor contracts allow emergency response fees\n\nPlease coordinate immediate response.
