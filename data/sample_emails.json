We've got 5 dumpsters worth of concrete demolition debris that needs to be cleared by Friday or we'll face penalties from the city.\n\nThe site is at 123 Main Street downtown - it's a tight space with limited truck access between 8 AM and 4 PM only due to traffic restrictions. We'll need roll-off containers, not standard dumpsters.\n\nThis is a union job so prevailing wage rates apply. The debris includes some rebar mixed in with the concrete - is that extra cost for sorting?\n\nPlease let me know pricing and confirm you can meet the Friday deadline. The general contractor is breathing down my neck on this one.\n\nThanks,\nMike Johnson\nSite Supervisor\nTiny's Demolition Services\n(555) 123-4567\nmjohnson@tinysdemolition.com",
