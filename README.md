# üìÑ README.md ‚Äì Semantic Email Router

### üß† **App Name:** Semantic Email Router

### üè∑ **Tagline:** From Unstructured Emails to Structured Intelligence ‚Äî Grounded in Your Data

---

## üìå Executive Summary

**Semantic Email Router** is a modular demo app that:

* Accepts **pasted email content** (e.g., customer orders, job requests).
* Leverages **reinforcement-learned AI agents** to **semantically parse and tag** the content.
* Extracts structured data for export to systems like **HubSpot**, **Salesforce**, or **SharePoint**.
* Provides a **Knowledge Base** tab to ground LLM understanding in fact-based documents (Excel, PDF, DOCX).
* Includes an **Admin tab** for **Outlook, SharePoint, and CRM integration** via **BYO API key** fields.
* Showcases **growing OGI (Organizational Graph Intelligence)** via iterative agent feedback and corrections.

1. Paste in an email.
2. Click **‚ÄúAnalyze Email‚Äù**.
3. See structured extraction:

   * **Intent** (e.g., order, job request)
   * **Entities** (product, quantity, dates)
   * **Suggested Routing Tags** (e.g., SharePoint folder, urgency)
   * **Knowledge Match Source**
   * **Confidence Scores**

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Admin / Integrations Tab**

**Purpose**: Set up connections to email systems (inbound) and target systems (outbound).

**Sections**:

#### üîë API Keys Section

* Outlook 365 / Gmail ‚Üí read incoming email
* SharePoint ‚Üí archive email + attachments
* Salesforce / Hubspot ‚Üí push extracted metadata
* S3 / Blob ‚Üí optional export destination

**UI**:

* `InputField + EyeToggle` for each API key (Lucide icons: Mail, Folder, UploadCloud, Database)

#### üîå MCP Integration Blocks (Modular)

* Outlook: webhook or Graph API (mail.read)
* SharePoint: REST or Graph API (file.create)
* HubSpot: contacts and engagement API
* Salesforce: REST for custom object creation

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Developer Guide Tab (for Demo Only)**

This modal or tab is meant to help internal engineers or POCs understand **how this app works**, and how to **customize it for a customer POC**.

#### üë®‚Äçüíª Developer Considerations

| Component                  | Notes                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agents**                 | Consider modular `CrewAI`/`LangGraph` agent chains for parsing, classification, matching, and routing.          |
| **Reinforcement Learning** | Allow tagging corrections by the user to be stored and retrained into fine-tuning loop (or logged as feedback). |
| **Document Grounding**     | Use small chunk size (256‚Äì512 tokens), cosine similarity >0.75 for confident matches.                           |
| **Scalability**            | RAG-based systems should implement fallback when no high-confidence match is found.                             |
| **Security**               | API key storage should be encrypted; suggest `.env` or Supabase secure vault.                                   |
| **Logging**                | Output agent traces in dev mode for debugging.                                                                  |

#### üîÅ Future Enhancements

* **Automated email polling** from connected Outlook inbox.
* **Auto-attachment parsing** for documents included in email.
* **SharePoint folder detection** based on tags (e.g., product type ‚Üí folder path).
* **Feedback loop** to improve tagging accuracy over time (RLHF pattern).
